# Interpretable_Machine_Learning
Selected machine learning analyzes. Each project utilises difference AI and ML techniques on different data sets.

**PROJECT 1:**

The data file contains simulated data from the operation of a certain production installation. Contains 13 measurements.<br> 
Target variable "power" was predicted based on decision tree algorithm with very good precision. <br> 

**PROJECT 2:**

Predicting House Prices PCA, TSNE, and XGBoost. <br>

Introduction  <br> 
This project consists of applying different techniques with the purpose of predicting the prices of houses in Ames, Iowa. I start by cleaning up the data, and then move on to implement Principle Component Analysis, TSNE, and finally, we use the XGBoost algorithm to predict the prices of houses.

Contents:

● Data Preprocessing <br> 
● PCA Decomposition <br> 
● TSNE Decomposition <br> 
● XGBoost <br> 
● Training the Model <br> 
● XGBoost Visual: Relative Importance <br> 

**PROJECT 3:**

The project analysing data from California Housing Prices. The aim is to predict prices of houses in California state (median_house_value) based on 9 features (longitude, latitude, housing_median_age, total_rooms, total_bedrooms, population, households, median_income, and ocean_proximity).

Contents:

● Data Preprocessing <br> 
● Data Visualization (include geographical data) <br> 
● Stratified sampling using Scikit-Learn’s StratifiedShuffleSplit() <br> 
● Handling Categorical Attributes using OneHotEncoder <br> 
● Custom Transformers and Transformation Pipelines <br> 
● Training model using Decision Tree and Random Forest <br> 
● Evaluation and Cross-Validation <br> 
● Grid Search <br> 
● Relative Importance of features <br>
