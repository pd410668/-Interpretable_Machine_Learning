# Interpretable_Machine_Learning
Selected machine learning analyzes. Each project utilises difference AI and ML techniques on different data sets.

**PROJECT 1:**

The data file contains simulated data from the operation of a certain production installation. Contains 13 measurements.<br> 
Target variable "power" was predicted based on decision tree algorithm with very good precision. <br> 

**PROJECT 2:**

Predicting House Prices PCA, TSNE, and XGBoost. <br>

Introduction  <br> 
This project consists of applying different techniques with the purpose of predicting the prices of houses in Ames, Iowa. I start by cleaning up the data, and then move on to implement Principle Component Analysis, TSNE, and finally, we use the XGBoost algorithm to predict the prices of houses.
